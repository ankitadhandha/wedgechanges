Webware/bin

The purpose of the Webware/bin directory is to contain various Webware utility scripts that don't necessarily fit in with a particular component or even the ordinary use of Webware.

Note that we write all the scripts in Python so that they function on both Windows and UNIX; e.g., no batch files or shell scripts.

Note: When creating new scripts, check them in from UNIX with full execute permissions the very first time.
