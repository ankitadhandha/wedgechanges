<h1>Webware for Python 0.7 Release Notes</h1>


<p> This release introduces a new version numbering policy.
Each Webware component will no longer have independent version numbers,
but instead all components' version numbers are updated in lock-step.
Therefore, all components in this release have version number 0.7.
That is not to say that all components are equally mature.
Each component still has a status indicator (found in Properties.py) that indicates whether the component is alpha, beta, or release quality.
This change is intended to make the Webware release process easier, and also we found that in practice, nobody ever referred to the
individual component release numbers anyhow.

<p> This release does not introduce any new components/packages, but instead adds new features and fixes bugs in existing packages.

<p> The install.py script was enhanced to auto-generate a random password for the Admin pages or let you specify your own password, either interactively or on the command-line.  Run "python install.py --help" for the options.

<p> For the changes to specific Webware components, please see the <a href=ComponentIndex.html>Component Index</a> for access to the documentation for each component.

<p> Also, visit the <a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net/>Webware home page</a> and <a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net/Wiki/>Wiki</a> for further information about Webware.
