This is a C coded cgi script for talking to the WebKit AppServer.  Just put it in a directory where your webserver can execute cgi's, and you're good to go.

By default, it will try to talk to the AppServer on host localhost on port 8086.  It'll retry the connection 10 times with a delay of 1 second between retries.

To change any of these parameters, put a file name webkit.cfg in the same directory as the cgi executable.  A sample file is included here.

Build Instructions:

On UNIX:
Just run make

On Windows:
A VC6 project file is included.  You will be able to get prebuilt binaries
from webware.sourceforge.net.  If you don't see any there, ask on the
webware-discuss mailing list.

Enjoy
