Webware/WebKit/ErrorMsgs/

This directory will contain error information captured by the WebKit application server. Each error is saved in it's own HTML file.

You can also access these files through the application administration pages (e.g., http://localhost/WebKit.cgi/Admin/).

See ../Documentation/WebKit.html for more information.
