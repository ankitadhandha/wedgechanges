	"""
	This is a version of Configurable that provides a customized setting() method for classes which have a serverSidePath() method. If a setting's name ends with "Filename" or "Dir", its value is passed through serverSidePath() before being returned.

	In other words, relative filenames and directory names are expanded with the location of the object, NOT the current directory.

	Application and AppServer are two well known users of this mix-in. Any class that has a serverSidePath() method and a Configurable base class, should inherit this class instead.
