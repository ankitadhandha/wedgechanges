stress.py
By Chuck Esterbrook
Mods by Jay Love

Purpose: Hit the WebKit AppServer with lots of a requests in order to:
	* Test for memory leaks
	* Test concurrency
	* Investigate performance

This stress test skips the web server and the WebKit adaptor, so it's not
useful for measuring absolute performance. However, after making a
modification to WebKit or your web-based application, it can be useful to
see the relative difference in performance (although still somewhat
unrealistic).

To Run:
	> stress.py  -OR-
	> python stress.py

This will give you the usage (and examples) which is:
	stress.py numRequests [minParallelRequests [maxParallelRequests [delay]]]

Programmatically, you could could also import this file and use the
stress() function.

To capture additional '.rr' files, which contain raw request
dictionaries, make use of the CGIAdaptor and uncomment the lines therein
that save the raw requests.

Caveat: HTTP cookies are blown away from the raw requests. Mostly due to
the fact that they will contain stale session ids.
