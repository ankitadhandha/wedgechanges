<p> COMKit allows Microsoft Windows users to use COM objects inside of their WebKit servlets.


<a name=Feedback><h2>Feedback</h2></a>

<p> <p> You can e-mail <a href=mailto:webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</a> to give feedback, discuss features and get help using COMKit.


<a name=Overview><h2>Overview</h2></a>

<p>If you try to use the win32com module within your WebKit servlets without using this plug-in, you will encounter COM errors
due to the fact that each thread used with COM needs to be initialized properly for COM usage.  This plug-in provides the
proper initialization of each WebKit thread to allow COM to work properly.

<p>When this plug-in is enabled, it configures COM in free-threading mode when used in conjunction with ThreadedAppServer or AsyncThreadedAppServer.
If you've never used COM before, or if you'd like to learn what "free-threading mode" means, you should get a copy of the fine book
Python Programming on Win32 by Mark Hammond and Andy Robinson and pay special attention to the chapters about COM and also Appendix D
for details on COM threading models.

<a name=Usage><h2>Usage</h2></a>

<p>To use COM, simply set EnableCOM to 1 in your AppServer.config file.  This causes the app server threads to be configured properly for
COM free-threading.  Then go ahead and use win32com inside your servlets.

<p>There's a simple example servlet that uses ADO for database access in ADOSample.py in the COMKit/Examples directory.
