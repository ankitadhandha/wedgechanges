<p> The MiddleKit browser allows you to browse the objects in a MiddleKit store, by using a user-defined object model. These object models are stored in the file system, on the same server as this web site.

<p> You can enter the pathname of the object model in the form above. An example, would be "/Webware/MiddleKit/Docs/Videos/Videos.mkmodel". You can leave the ".mkmodel" extension off if you want.

<p> Or, if you have browsed models at this site before, you can choose one from the recent list.

<p> Or, you may choose a "known model" if the site admin has configured this site.
