<h1>MiddleKit 0.2 Release Notes</h1>
Version 0.2
<br>Webware for Python 0.6


<ul>
	<li> Version 0.2 was released on 12/2/2001.

	<li> If you use 'Extras' column in your 
object model file (Classes.csv), then pay attention: The 'Extras' column is 
now processed with MiscUtil's PyDictForArgs() rather than DictForArgs(). [Chuck]

<p> The downside is that values like:
        <blockquote>x=1 y=2</blockquote>

<p> Must be edited or your model cannot be read:
        <blockquote>x=1; y=2</blockquote>

<p> The upside is that you can use full Python expressions, so ints come in as 
ints (instead of strings) and you can create lists and so on:
        <blockquote>Samples=[1, 2, 3]</blockquote>

<p> Which was the motivation for this change.


	<li> MiddleKit developers are now encouraged to always put their Python classes in a Python package. The <a href=QuickStart.html>Quick Start</a> takes you through this process. [Chuck]

	<li> MiddleKit now supports deleting objects including some powerful options regarding the relationships between objects and deleting. See the <a href=UsersGuide.html>User's Guide</a> for details. [Geoff T]

	<li> <b>Type and value checking:</b> Accessor methods such as setFoo() now do type checking and 
value checking on their arguments. [Chuck] For example, you can't pass in a string for a boolean:

<pre class=py>obj.setSomeBool('s')  # raises TypeError
</pre>

	<p> Some numeric compatibility is allowed:

		<ul>
			<li> ints can take longs that don't overflow the int range
			<li> longs can take ints
			<li> floats can take ints and longs
		</ul>

	<p> The date, time and datetime accessors no longer accept strings (such as 
'2001-01-15') if you have an mx.DateTime.

	<p> For value checking:

	<ul>
		<li> bools only take 0 or 1
		<li> enums only take valid strings found in the enum def
	</ul>

	<p> Also, MiddleKit assumes that if you have DateTime, it is in the mx package, 
as in:

<pre class=py>from mx import DateTime</pre>

	<li> MK previously spewed all it's SQL statements to stdout. The new default 
behavior is not to log anything, but you can change this via the SQLLog option described in the <a href=UsersGuide.html#ConfigurationUsersGuide.html>configuration section</a> of the User's Guide. [Chuck]

	<li> MiddleObject.setValueForKey() now raises LookupError instead of NameError if there is a problem. This is consistent with valueForKey() and fits the doc strings of the exceptions better. [Chuck]

	<li> Miscellaneous fixes and refinements. [Chuck, Geoff T, Dave R]

</ul>
