Flamenco example collection: Nobel Prize winners
------------------------------------------------

This example collection contains the winners of the Nobel Prizes from
1901 to 2004.  Each item is a winner of the Nobel Prize.

As facets.tsv shows, the items are classified by gender, home country,
affiliation, the year of the Nobel Prize, and the type of the Nobel
Prize awarded.  And as attrs.tsv shows, each winner has a "usual name"
(such as "Max Planck"), a "long name" (such as "Max Karl Ernst Ludwig
Planck"), URL to a photo, and URL to their Nobel Lecture.  Individual
winners also have a URL to a biography and years of birth and death;
organizations have a URL to a description of their history.

The two files facets.tsv and attrs.tsv were written by hand.  The
file nobel.txt was produced by the script "getnobel", which gathers
information from webpages at http://nobelprize.org/.  nobel.txt was
then edited by hand to make the affiliation names more consistent.
The script "makefacets" processed nobel.txt to produce all the other
*.tsv files in this directory:
    
    items.tsv               text.tsv

    gender_terms.tsv        gender_map.tsv
    country_terms.tsv       country_map.tsv
    affiliation_terms.tsv   affiliation_map.tsv
    prize_terms.tsv         prize_map.tsv
    year_terms.tsv          year_map.tsv

Running "flamenco import" on this directory will use the *.tsv files
to create a new Flamenco instance for the Nobel Prize dataset.

Please see the detailed documentation in the "doc" directory for more
information on how to format a collection for loading into Flamenco.
