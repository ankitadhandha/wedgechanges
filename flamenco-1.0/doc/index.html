<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Flamenco is a web-based interface
for browsing large collections of items
such as documents or photographs.
In a Flamenco collection,
each item is assigned
one or more <dfn>category terms</dfn>
from one or more <dfn>facets</dfn>.
A facet is a set of categories;
for example, buildings could be classified
under a "material" facet (with categories such as "brick" and "wood")
and a "location" facet (with categories such as "France" and "Winnipeg").
In a <dfn>hierarchical</dfn> facet,
the categories are arranged in a hierarchy tree.
So, in our example, the "location" facet
could be hierarchical,
with "Winnipeg" a subcategory under "Manitoba",
and "Manitoba" a subcategory under "Canada".

<p>
We assume that at this point you have a collection of items
that have already been assigned into faceted categories.
(To give you a quick start,
the Flamenco distribution includes a <a href=example.html>sample collection</a>.)
This set of web pages explains how to set up Flamenco
to provide a flexible web-based interface
for browsing and searching your collection.

<h4>About the Project</h4>

<p>
FLAMENCO stands for FLexible information Access using MEtadata in
Novel COmbinations. 
Flamenco was developed as a research project in the
<a href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/">
School of Information</a> at the
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">
University of California, Berkeley</a>.

This research was supported by a CAREER grant awarded to Prof. Marti
Hearst from the <a href=http://www.nsf.gov>National Science
Foundation</a>, NSF IIS-9984741.  For more details on the project, see
the <a href="http://flamenco.berkeley.edu/">Flamenco website</a> which
includes 
<a href="http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/flamenco-pubs.html">
publications about Flamenco</a>,  
<a href="http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/flamenco-talks.html">
powerpoint presentations</a> describing the project,

<h4> Project Contributors </h4>

<p>
Many people from the School of Information and the Computer Science
Division of UC Berkeley contributed to this project.

<ul>
<li> <span class="facet">Marti Hearst</span> developed the initial
ideas, wrote the NSF grant proposal, designed aspects of the
interface, directed the project, and worked on the documentation.
<li> <span class="facet">Ka-Ping Yee</span> designed the software architecture, devised the database schema,
designed some of the interface features, and implemented most of the
software, including the installation package and its documentation.
<li> <span class="facet">Rashmi Sinha</span> guided the design of some of the user studies and
conducted the statistical analysis of some of the study data.
<li> <span class="facet">Kevin Li</span> implemented many interface design features, implemented a baseline
system for comparison purposes, added many new instances, and
contributed to the design and conduction of the longitudinal study.
<li> <span class="facet">Ame Elliott</span> interviewed target users and designed and evaluated
early paper prototypes.
<li> <span class="facet">Kirsten Swearingen</span> tested and documented the interfaces, developed and
conducting user studies, and edited and organized metadata.
<li> <span class="facet">Emilia Stoica</span> implemented and evaluated algorithms for automated
facet creation and assignment.
<li> <span class="facet">Brycen Chun</span> implemented a browser for assigning metadata to categories.
</ul>

In addition, a number of beta testers helped us make sure the software
release worked well:
